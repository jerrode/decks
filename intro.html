Reason #1

### <b class="skyblue">Logic</b> and <b class="pink">code</b> are coupled.

Reason #2

### <b class="orange">Prototyping</b> is far from <b class="yellow">production</b>.

Reason #3

### <b class="skyblue">Devops</b> is difficult.

## Architecture <b class="yellow">flaws</b>.

---

### <b class="orange">Monoliths</b> are globs of tape and glue.

One stack with language restrictions.

Difficult to scale properly.

High techniqual debt.

### <b class="skyblue">Orchestrating microservices</b> sucks.

Focus on architecture vs application design.

Hard to avoid service coupling.

Data-flow is not transparent.
