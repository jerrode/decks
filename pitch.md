# Pitch Outline
Where are we today architecture: Monoliths vs microservice.
Future is in microservice, but the devops overhead is to signifcant.
Asyncy is the platform that bridges this gap.
A platform for choreographed microservices.
Explain what parts of the platform fix what issues with microservices.
Explain the advantage of a domain specific language.
Explain the seperate of logic and code leading to rapid prototyping.
Explain why open source.
How to get involved.

# Long Pitch

> Our mission is to build a platform where application development is 10-100x faster using microservices with no devops experience.

## Our Story

The story behind Asyncy starts with Storyscript, our domain-specific language.
Years back while working on applications for small businesses customers asked for unique, long-running business logic to automate marketing and customer retention, among other business logic.
These stories were written down in a format that the client could read and understand the logic behind the application.
A transparent, syntax-light, language emerged through the common logic patterns that read like a book.
Storyscript was born and paved the way for a new technique of rapidly prototyping applications.

## Today

In 2018, there is a healthy ecosystem around devops and orchestration, not to mention microservices being all the buzz, for-better or for-worse.
The industry is shifting towards microservices, however, the devops overhead is far to signifcant for mass market adoption. Yet, it remains the future of application development.
For small, medium, even large teams, microservices is not a good fit for two primary reasons.
First, microservices requires signifcant devops experience forcing architecture design rather than applications building.
Second, the slippery slope of container coupling which leads to high techniqual debt resulting in a tangled mess of interlocked services (i.e. a microservice monolith).

## The Dawn of Choreographed Microservices

A new term in the industry which has not yet been defined by a product.
However, it has been mentioned in several publications which point to this concept as the future of microservices.

Microservice choreography we define as a platform above orchestration where containers (aka microservices) communicate with the platform
to eliminate container coupling, automate devops while providing a transparent application data and logic flow.

## The Asyncy Platform

Storyscript is our language for microservice choreography. It decouples logic from code; serivces from other services.
An expressive language that is rich of functionality and built-in logic, yet transparent and flexible.

Asyncy is the platform for Storyscript execution, service discovery, contininoius-integration, contininoius-delivery and service marketplace.
Open source and cloud agnostic, Asyncy uses Kubernetes to automate orchestration and provides the architecture for all devop lifecycles.

Asyncy improves application development by providing a platform for rapid prototyping to production.
Developers write stories then code. We provide a rich service discovery with highly integrated tools into the development workflow.

### Features
1. Open source and cloud agnostic.
1. Storyscript for transparent choreography.
1. Emporium for service discovery and marketplace (i.e., Docker Hub + GitHub Marketplace)
1. Hub for application management, metrics and health (i.e. Heroku)
1. Engine for Storyscript execution.
1. Automated container orchestration using Kubernetes under-the-hood.
1. Simulator for a powerful contininoius-integration and contininoius-delivery.
1. Atom Plugin for integrated development workflows and machine learning assisted logic.
